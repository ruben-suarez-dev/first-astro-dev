    I have worked on various computer projects in my short career as a developer. Initially, I focused on game development, working with different platforms to create them (Unity, Unreal Engine 4, Phaser). However, currently <strong>I am fascinated by web development</strong>, where I have been able to collaborate on 2 major projects in Falabella Financiero using Angular.
